SPACED REPETITION FOR CLAUDE
=============================

WHAT IT IS
----------
Adds spaced repetition to Claude. Instead of flashcards, you store instructions
for Claude to generate practice problems. Your cards follow you everywhere Claude
goes - web, desktop, mobile.


WHAT IT DOES
------------
You tell Claude what to help you practice. Claude generates problems, you solve
them together, then rate the difficulty. The system schedules your next review
using the same algorithm as Anki (SM-2).

Example:
  You: "Add a card to help me practice Python decorators"
  Claude: "Created card 1"

  You: "What's due today?"
  Claude: Shows your cards

  You: "Give me a decorator problem"
  Claude: Creates a custom problem for you

  You: [work through it together]

  You: "That was medium, rate it 3"
  Claude: "Next review in 6 days"


SETUP (5 MINUTES)
-----------------

1. Connect to Claude:
   - Go to: https://claude.ai/settings/integrations
   - Click "Add custom connector"
   - Paste: https://spaced-mcp-server.spaced-repetition-mcp.workers.dev/mcp
   - Authorize with GitHub (one-time)
   - Done

2. Test it:
   - In any Claude chat, ask: "What cards are due today?"
   - Should work immediately


BASIC COMMANDS
--------------
Just talk naturally to Claude:

  "Add a card about [topic]"
  "Add a card about binary trees with tags algorithms,coding"
  "What's due today?"
  "Show all my cards"
  "Give me a problem for card 5"
  "That was hard, rate it 2"
  "That was easy, rate it 5"
  "Search for python cards"
  "Show me stats"
  "Delete card 3"


DIFFICULTY RATINGS
------------------
After working on a problem:
  1 = Failed completely, show again tomorrow
  2 = Very hard, struggled a lot
  3 = Medium, some difficulty
  4 = Good, got it with minor help
  5 = Easy, knew it cold


HOW THE SCHEDULING WORKS
-------------------------
- First review: 1 day later
- Second review: 6 days later
- After that: exponentially longer (based on how easy you found it)
- If you fail (rate 1): resets to 1 day


FEATURES
--------
- Full-text search across all cards
- Tag-based organization
- Statistics (total cards, cards due, breakdown by tag)
- Works on Claude web, desktop, and code
- Your cards sync automatically
- Free (Cloudflare free tier)


PRIVACY
-------
Your cards are private. Each GitHub user has completely isolated data.
Even the server admin can't see your cards through Claude.


TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------
- Hosted on: Cloudflare Workers (serverless)
- Database: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)
- Authentication: GitHub OAuth
- Algorithm: SM-2 (same as Anki)
- Protocol: MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Code: Open source, TypeScript


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

"No tools available"
  - Hover over the hammer icon (🔨) at bottom of Claude
  - If empty, try disconnecting and reconnecting the integration
  - Make sure you authorized with GitHub

"Card not found"
  - Each GitHub account has separate cards
  - Make sure you're using the same GitHub account

"Connection failed"
  - Check the URL is exactly: .../mcp (not .../sse)
  - Try in incognito/private browser window
  - Check you're logged into GitHub

EXAMPLE SESSION
---------------
You: Add a card to practice derivatives with chain rule, tag it calculus

Claude: Created card 1

You: What's due?

Claude: Card 1: Generate derivative problems using chain rule
        Tags: calculus
        Due: today

You: Give me a derivative problem

Claude: Find the derivative of f(x) = sin(x²)

You: Is it 2x·cos(x²)?

Claude: Exactly right! That's the chain rule: derivative of outer function
        times derivative of inner function.

You: That was pretty easy, rate it 4

Claude: Card 1 reviewed. Next review: October 9 (in 6 days)


THAT'S IT
---------
Start with: "Add a card about [something you want to practice]"
